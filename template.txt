Additional instructions for commit message generation:

STYLE GUIDELINES:

- Keep title under 50 characters
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Use present tense
- Be specific and concise

CONTENT FOCUS:

- Emphasize user-facing changes
- Explain WHY the change was made, not just WHAT
- Include impact on performance or behavior if significant
- Mention related issue/ticket numbers if visible in comments

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

- For bug fixes: briefly describe the bug and the fix
- For features: describe the new capability
- For refactors: explain the improvement or simplification
- For performance: include metrics if available

TONE:

- Direct and clear
- No fluff or unnecessary words

EXAMPLES OF GOOD COMMITS:

AVOID:
